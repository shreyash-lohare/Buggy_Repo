# CHECK_BUGS.txt - Potential Bugs to Fix

## Backend Issues

### main.py
- BUG #1: Missing users router import
  - The users.py router is not imported or included in the application
  - FIX: Add 'from routes.users import router as users_router' and 'app.include_router(users_router)'

### db.py
- BUG #4: Missing quiz collection reference
  - The init_db() function doesn't return a quiz collection
  - The analytics route is trying to access collections that aren't included in the return dict

### routes/items.py
- BUG #5: Incorrect router initialization
  - 'router = {}' should be 'router = APIRouter()'
  - This prevents FastAPI from recognizing the routes

- BUG #6: Duplicate route handler
  - Two '@router.post(\
/\)' functions with the same path
  - Only the last one will be used, making the first one inaccessible
  
- BUG #7: Incorrect delete endpoint design
  - The delete handler tries to delete two items but only one should be needed
  - 'item_details' parameter is incorrectly used

### routes/analytics.py
- BUG #8: Incorrect property access
  - Using 'names' and 'usernames' keys which don't match the model structure
  - Should match the property names from models.py
  
- BUG #9: Hard-coded users array
  - 'users = [\A1\,\B2\,\C3\]' shouldn't be there if fetching from DB
  - It overrides the database results

### routes/users.py
- BUG #10: Wrong HTTP method
  - '@router.post(\/\)' is used for the get_users function
  - Should be '@router.get(\/\)' to follow REST conventions
  
- BUG #11: Incorrect delete function
  - 'collection.delete_all()' method doesn't exist in MongoDB
  - Should be 'collection.delete_one({\_id\: ObjectId(user_id)})'
